## Represents a single node in the Trie
class TrieNode:
    """
    Represents a single node in a Trie data structure.

    Implements the basic functionality of a Trie node,
    including character insertion and end-of-word marking.

    Attributes:
        children (dict): A dictionary of child nodes, where keys are characters
                         and values are TrieNode objects.
        is_end_of_word (bool): Flag indicating if this node represents
                               the end of a word.

    Time complexity:
        - Initialization: O(1)
        - Node insertion: O(1) average case

            char (str): The character to insert.
